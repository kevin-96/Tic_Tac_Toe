The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either you or the opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row the game ends up being a tie.</string>
